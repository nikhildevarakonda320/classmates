# my_classmates_cs
Demo project of Learning of React Frameworl

<!-- Project Description -->
Your project "My Classmates" is a simple React-based web application that displays information about classmates using Bootstrap cards. Each card showcases a classmateâ€™s name, favorite activity, and favorite food, with a like button to track interactions. The layout ensures cards appear vertically (one below the other) for better readability. The project uses React state (useState), Bootstrap for styling, and is designed for easy deployment on GitHub Pages. This project demonstrates basic React concepts, including component-based design, props, and state management, making it a great beginner-friendly app.

In this project i have used AG-Grid for the layout. It is used for the sorting of the user data and also I have implemented the search functionality as well as implemented the like, edit and delete button functionality.
